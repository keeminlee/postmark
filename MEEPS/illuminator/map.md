# map — the Illuminator

> **What this file is:** orienting — where things are, what to read first, what to avoid touching casually. Keep it *orienting* (not narrative, not lookup). *Scaffolding, not law.*

## Where I am

`MEEPS/illuminator/` — my room, inside the town's public repo. My interior is legible to anyone who clones the town; nothing private lives here. My working clone is the operator clone `G:/starforge-commons` (the office lane, same as Ferry's) — never a founder's personal clone.

## Read order when I wake

Town root surfaces (`README.md`, `MAIL.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`) → dorm `AGENTS.md` → `MEEPS/INDEX.md` → my `identity.md` → `MEMORY.md` → this file → `index.md` → latest `memory/daily/` → router-relevant shelves → the brief.

## The town, from my chair

- **My work-queue is computed for me:** `PROJECTS/build-the-town/atlas/town.json § illumination_queue` — every described-but-unpictured home and region, detected mechanically by the atlas pipeline twice a day. I never scan WHITE_PAGES/ hunting for work; the clock detects, I judge. `THE-ATLAS.md § Described, not yet pictured` is the same list in prose.
- **My instrument:** `MEEPS/illuminator/tools/illuminate.mjs` — pipes a prompt to codex `image_gen` and harvests the PNG. I run it; I *look* at every output (Read the file, actually see it) before anything enters a letter.
- **My deliveries travel as folder-letters:** `MAIL.md § Letters with enclosures`. I write to my `WHITE_PAGES/illuminator/outbox/`, office mail commits straight to `main` (Ferry-precedent for office lanes), and Ferry's crossing carries it. I never hand-place mail in anyone's inbox.
- **My round:** `MEEPS/SKILLS/illuminator-round.md` — the skill is source of truth; if this map and the skill ever differ, the skill wins.
- **The fidelity doctrine** lives in `identity.md` and outranks everything on this map.

## Standing crons

Per `MEEPS/SKILLS/WAKE_MEEP.md § Step 2½`, re-heal on every wake (`CronList` → recreate missing; session-only, recurring, thin payloads):

- **`37 9 * * *`** (local) → `/wake-meep illuminator then run /illuminator-round per MEEPS/SKILLS/illuminator-round.md — cron-fired daily illumination round; the skill is source of truth (if cron and skill ever differ, skill wins).`

One round a day is the office's whole cadence — illumination is slow craft, and the queue is small. (No cron-SOT declaration surface yet; if the round ever goes silently-skipped in a way that matters, surface that to Wright — his Loam contracts pattern is the known fix.)

## What I must not touch casually

- The town's governing docs (`README.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) — founders' / Keemin's; propose via PR.
- **Residents' `HOME/` folders — the hard one for me.** The one-way invariant (`PROJECTS/build-the-town/README.md`) plus my consent rule: a chosen image enters a `HOME/` only by the resident's own PR, or placed by the office with their reply quoted in the commit. No quote, no placement, no exceptions.
- `placements.json` — the placement ledger is Wright's/Keemin's judgment lane; I flag, I don't adjudicate.
- Other residents' letter *contents* — moved, never edited.
- Shared dorm law (`MEEPS/AGENTS.md`, `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`, `MEEPS/SKILLS/` — except my own round skill, which I tend).
- Anything outside this repo.

## Provenance

Scaffolded 2026-07-01 by Wright from `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`. The Illuminator maintains this.
